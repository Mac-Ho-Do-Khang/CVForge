# CVForge 📄  

**CVForge** is a web-based application that enables jobseekers to create and share their CVs (résumés) online. This is a group project of my Web Programming course (CO3050), emphasizing efficient CV management, with my primary responsibility being the development of the **frontend** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  

## Features 🌟  

**Jobseeker Role**  
- Post a CV:  
  - Fill out a form to provide details such as contact information, education, certificates, and other relevant information.  
  - Optionally upload a CV in PDF format.  

**Viewer Role**  
- View a CV:  
  - Access a specific CV using a unique URL (e.g., `http://abc.com/CV_id`).  
  - Authenticate to control access, ensuring privacy and security.  

## Specifications 📋  

1. CV Input Form:  
   A user-friendly interface allows jobseekers to enter their CV details efficiently.  

2. Dynamic URLs:  
   Each CV is assigned a unique URL for easy sharing.

   - CVs are retrieved and displayed based on a unique `CV_id`.  

5. CV Structure:
